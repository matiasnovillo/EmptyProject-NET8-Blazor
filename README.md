Welcome to the .NET 8 and Blazor web template.

With this exclusive template that uses the latest technologies in the IT market, you can reduce the preparation time to work with .NET 8 and Blazor.

Create web applications quickly with HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 5, C#, .NET 8, Blazor, EF Core and MS SQL Server.

By default, this template comes loaded with several components:
- Integrated CMS to manage content depending on the user entering the site
- Error catching and saving important variables in a separate table in the database
- Repository pattern
- Dependency injection (DI)
- EF Core
- For the user interface (UI), the Creative-Tim template (in conjunction with Google), Material, is used
- An endpoint to fill in the essential tables

Now, if you want to go a little further, I invite you to use FiyiStack, the low-code generator, which uses this template as a base to reduce development and delivery times.
